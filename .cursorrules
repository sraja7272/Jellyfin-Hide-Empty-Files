# Cursor Rules for Jellyfin Plugin

## Project Context

This is a Jellyfin plugin (version 1.0) that creates custom home sections displaying only media with valid, accessible files.

### Key Information
- **Current Version**: 1.0.0
- **Purpose**: Filter out broken symlinks and missing files from home screen sections
- **Filtering Method**: Checks file sizes (excludes items where Size == null or Size == 0)
- **NOT** a library exclusion plugin (despite the internal name "ExcludedLibraries")

### Historical Context
- Development history and old changelogs are in `CHANGELOG_OLD.md`
- This plugin went through major refactoring in version 3.0+ before being reset to 1.0
- Uses reflection for Jellyfin 10.10/10.11 compatibility

### Code Style
- All logs should use `[ExcludedLibraries]` prefix
- Use reflection for Jellyfin API calls that changed between versions
- Version numbers should always be kept in sync across:
  - `src/Jellyfin.Plugin.ExcludedLibraries.csproj`
  - `src/Plugin.cs`
  - `src/Configuration/configPage.html`
  - `build.yaml`
